Futhermore, the low-dimensional data can be visualized in frame, can feel by human. Hence, In this post, I simply summarized some mathematics model for PCA and t-SNE algorithms, implemented these methods repectively, and presented some advangtages and disadvantages of these alogorithms. At the end, some important hyperparameters that effect the performance of t-SNE are described to remind readers to choose the proper parameters. Some other demension reduction methods were summarized as follows:\n  PCA (linear); t-SNE (non-parametric/ nonlinear); Sammon mapping (nonlinear); Isomap (nonlinear); LLE (nonlinear); CCA (nonlinear); SNE (nonlinear); MVU (nonlinear); Laplacian Eigenmaps (nonlinear),   and their attributes were shown in the below figure. 1. PCA Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a process of computing principal components using the first few principal component and ignoring the rest. The goals of PCA are to\n  extract the most important information from the data table; compress the size of the data set by keeping only this important information; simplify the description of the data set; and analyze the structure of the observations and the variables.   The PCA can be defined commonly by two methods, resulting in the same algorithme. As shown in the following figure, principal component analysis seeks a space of lower dimensionality, known as the principal subspace and denoted by the magenta line, such that the orthogonal projection of the data points (red dots) onto this subspace maximizes the variance of the projected points (green dots). An alternative definition of PCA is based on minimizing the sum-of-squares of the projection errors, indicated by the blue lines. 1.1 Maxiunum variance formulation Consider a data set of observations $\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{n}\\right\\}$ where $n = 1, \\cdots, N$ and the dimensionality of $\\mathbf{x}_{n}$ is $D$. The PCA can project the data on to lower dimensional space with dimensionality $M \u0026lt; D$ while maximizing the variance of the projected data. We define unit vector ${{w}_{1}}$, which is column vector, as the first principal direction and each data point $\\mathbf{x}_{n}$ is then projected onto a scalar value ${{z}_{1}^n} = \\mathbf{{w}_{1}^{T}}{{{x}}_{n}}$. Based on the above definition, we preject all data points onto $\\mathbf{w_1}$ direction, maximizing the variance along $\\mathbf{w_1}$ direction, $$\\max Var\\left( {{\\mathbf{z}}_{1}} \\right)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{1}^{N}{{{\\left( {{\\mathbf{z}}_{1}}-{{{\\mathbf{\\bar{z}}}}_{1}} \\right)}^{2}}},{{\\left|| {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \\right||}_{2}}=1, $$ where $\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ is $[z_1^{1}, z_2^{1}, \\cdots, z_N^{1}]$, and ${{{\\mathbf{\\bar{z}}}}_{1}}$ is sample set mean, given by ${{\\mathbf{\\bar{z}}}_{1}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{z_{i}^{1}}$. The above formulation is also used in other principal direction like $\\mathbf{w_2}$, so the variance of data set $\\mathbf{z_2}$ can be derived by $$\\max Var\\left( {{\\mathbf{z}}_{2}} \\right)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{1}^{N}{{{\\left( {{\\mathbf{z}}_{2}}-{{{\\mathbf{\\bar{z}}}}_{2}} \\right)}^{2}}},{{\\left|| {{\\mathbf{w}}_{2}} \\right||}_{2}}=1$$ As a result, the low-dimensional data points $$\\mathbf{z}=W\\mathbf{x}, $$\nwhere $W$ is $\\left[ \\begin{matrix} {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \u0026amp; {{\\mathbf{w}}_{2}} \u0026amp; {{\\mathbf{w}}_{3}} \u0026amp; \\cdots \\end{matrix} \\right]$, and it is a orthogonal matrix. The variance of data set $\\mathbf{z_1}$ can be derived\n\\begin{align} Var\\left( {{{\\mathbf{{z}}}}_{1}} \\right) \u0026amp; =\\frac{1}{N}{{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{\\left( z_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{z}}}^{1}} \\right)}}^{2}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\u0026amp; =\\frac{1}{N}{{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{\\left( \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}x_{i}^{1}-\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right)}}^{2}} \\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp; =\\frac{1}{N}{{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{\\left[ \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right) \\right]}}^{2}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right)\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right)} \\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp; =\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right)}{{\\left[ \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right) \\right]}^{\\text{T}}} \\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp; =\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}\\left[ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}{\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right)}{{\\left( x_{i}^{1}-{{{\\bar{x}}}^{1}} \\right)}^{\\text{T}}} \\right]{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \\nonumber\\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}} cov\\left( \\mathbf x\\right) \\mathbf{w}_{1}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{align}\nwhere $S = cov\\left( \\mathbf x\\right)$ is covariance matrix of data set $\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{n}\\right\\}$, and it is a sysmetric and semidefinite matrix. Eventually, if we want to obtain the principal vector $\\mathbf{w_1}$, the optimization equation is\n\\begin{align} \\underset{{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}}}{\\mathop{\\max }},\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}S{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}},\\\\\ns.t.\\quad \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} = 1. \\end{align}\nUsing the Langrange multiplier, $$g\\left( {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \\right)=\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}S{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}}+\\alpha \\left( 1-\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{\\text{T}}{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \\right), $$\nlet $\\frac{\\partial g\\left( {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \\right)}{\\partial {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}}}=0$, the following equation can be obtianed $$\\frac{\\partial g\\left( {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} \\right)}{\\partial {{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}}}=S{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}}-\\alpha{{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}} =0$$ Hence, the ${{\\mathbf{w}}_{1}}$ and $\\alpha$ are the eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue of covariance matrix $S$. Moreover, $\\alpha$ is the first largest eigenvalue. Also, the ${{\\mathbf{w}}_{2}}$ is the corresponding eigenvetor related to the second largest eigenvalue of $S$.\n2. t-SNE t-SNE is a mechine learning algorithm for visualazation developed by Sam Roweis and Geoggrey Hinton, well suitied for embedding high-dimensiontal data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimension observed directly by human. It is extensively applied in image processing, NLP, genomic data and speech processing. The t-SNE puts emphasis on (1) modeling dissimilar datapoints by means of large pairwise distances, and (2) modeling similar datapoints by means of small pairwise distances. To keep things simple, here’s a brief overview of working of t-SNE:\n  The algorithms starts by calculating the probability of similarity of points in high-dimensional space and calculating the probability of similarity of points in the corresponding low-dimensional space. The similarity of points is calculated as the conditional probability that a point A would choose point B as its neighbor if neighbors were picked in proportion to their probability density under a Gaussian (normal distribution) centered at A. It then tries to minimize the difference between these conditional probabilities (or similarities) in higher-dimensional and lower-dimensional space for a perfect representation of data points in lower-dimensional space. To measure the minimization of the sum of difference of conditional probability t-SNE minimizes the sum of Kullback-Leibler divergence of overall data points using a gradient descent method.   2.1 Mathematics model Step 1: Define similarity in high-dimensional space t-SNE uses Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (SNE) method to convert the high-dimensional Euclidean distances between data points into conditional probablities that represent their similiarities. The conditional probability ${{p}_{j|i}}$ is defined to represent the similarity, $x_i$ would choose $x_j$ as its neighhour if neighours are chosen in proportion to their probablity density under a Guassian with center at $x_i$. The nearer the data points are, the higher value of ${{p}_{j|i}}$ is. Mathematically, ${{p}_{j|i}}$ can be defined by $${\\displaystyle p_{j\\mid i}={\\frac {\\exp(-\\lVert \\mathbf {x} _{i}-\\mathbf {x} _{j}\\rVert ^{2}/2\\sigma _{i}^{2})}{\\sum _{k\\neq i}\\exp(-\\lVert \\mathbf {x} _{i}-\\mathbf {x} _{k}\\rVert ^{2}/2\\sigma _{i}^{2})}}}, $$ where $\\sigma_i$ is the variance of the Guassian distribution with the mean being $x_i$. Morever $p_{ij} $is defined by $${\\displaystyle p_{ij}={\\frac {p_{j\\mid i}+p_{i\\mid j}}{2N}}}$$ where $p_{ii} = 0$ and $p_{ij} = p_{ji}$.\nStep 2: Define similarity in low-dimensional space For the low-dimensional counterparts $y_i$ and $y_j$ of the high-dimensional data points $x_i$ and $x_j$. It is possible to define a similar conditional probability, donoted by $q_{ij}$ $${\\displaystyle q_{ij}={\\frac {(1+\\lVert \\mathbf {y} _{i}-\\mathbf {y} _{j}\\rVert ^{2})^{-1}}{\\sum _{k}\\sum _{l\\neq k}(1+\\lVert \\mathbf {y} _{k}-\\mathbf {y} _{l}\\rVert ^{2})^{-1}}}}, $$ where $q_{ii} = 0$.\nStep 3: Define cost function to compute $q_{ij}$ If the map points $y_i$ and $y_j$ correctly model the similarity between the high-dimensional datapoints $x_i$ and $x_j$, the conditional probabilities $p_{j|i}$ and $q_{j|i}$ will be equal. Motivated by this observation, SNE aims to find a low-dimensional data representation that minimizes the mismatch between $p_{j|i}$ and $q_{j|i}$. A natural measure of the faithfulness with which $q_{j|i}$ models $p_{j|i}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (which is in this case equal to the cross-entropy up to an additive constant). SNE minimizes the sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences over all datapoints using a gradient descent method. The cost function C is given by $$C= \\sum_{}{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {KL} \\left(P\\parallel Q\\right)=\\sum _{i\\neq j}p_{ij}\\log {\\frac {p_{ij}}{q_{ij}}}}$$ in which $P$ represents the conditional probability distribution over all other datapoints given datapoint $x$, and $Q$ represents the conditional probability distribution over all other map points given map point $y$. The defination of $p_{ij}$ and $q_{ij}$ solves the crowding problem for SNE from Laurens van der Maaten in Visualizing Data using t-SNE. The gradient of the Kullback-Leibler divergence $C$ is derived (the detailed derived procedure was presented in Visualizing Data using t-SNE) $$\\frac{\\delta C}{\\delta {{y}_{i}}}=4\\sum\\limits_{j}{\\left( {{p}_{ij}}-{{q}_{ij}} \\right)}\\left( {{y}_{i}}-{{y}_{j}} \\right){{\\left( 1+{{\\left| {{y}_{i}}-{{y}_{j}} \\right|}^{2}} \\right)}^{-1}}$$\n2.2 Implementing PCA in python3 ## Inherited from personal page of Laurens van der Maaten ## https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/ import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def Hbeta(D=np.array([]), beta=1.0): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Compute the perplexity and the P-row for a specific value of the precision of a Gaussian distribution. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Compute P-row and corresponding perplexity P = np.exp(-D.copy() * beta) sumP = sum(P) H = np.log(sumP) + beta * np.sum(D * P) / sumP P = P / sumP return H, P def x2p(X=np.array([]), tol=1e-5, perplexity=30.0): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Performs a binary search to get P-values in such a way that each conditional Gaussian has the same perplexity. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Initialize some variables print(\u0026quot;Computing pairwise distances...\u0026quot;) (n, d) = X.shape sum_X = np.sum(np.square(X), 1) D = np.add(np.add(-2 * np.dot(X, X.T), sum_X).T, sum_X) P = np.zeros((n, n)) beta = np.ones((n, 1)) logU = np.log(perplexity) # Loop over all datapoints for i in range(n): # Print progress if i % 500 == 0: print(\u0026quot;Computing P-values for point %d of %d...\u0026quot; % (i, n)) # Compute the Gaussian kernel and entropy for the current precision betamin = -np.inf betamax = np.inf Di = D[i, np.concatenate((np.r_[0:i], np.r_[i+1:n]))] (H, thisP) = Hbeta(Di, beta[i]) # Evaluate whether the perplexity is within tolerance Hdiff = H - logU tries = 0 while np.abs(Hdiff) \u0026gt; tol and tries \u0026lt; 50: # If not, increase or decrease precision if Hdiff \u0026gt; 0: betamin = beta[i].copy() if betamax == np.inf or betamax == -np.inf: beta[i] = beta[i] * 2. else: beta[i] = (beta[i] + betamax) / 2. else: betamax = beta[i].copy() if betamin == np.inf or betamin == -np.inf: beta[i] = beta[i] / 2. else: beta[i] = (beta[i] + betamin) / 2. # Recompute the values (H, thisP) = Hbeta(Di, beta[i]) Hdiff = H - logU tries += 1 # Set the final row of P P[i, np.concatenate((np.r_[0:i], np.r_[i+1:n]))] = thisP # Return final P-matrix print(\u0026quot;Mean value of sigma: %f\u0026quot; % np.mean(np.sqrt(1 / beta))) return P def pca(X=np.array([]), no_dims=50): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Runs PCA on the NxD array X in order to reduce its dimensionality to no_dims dimensions. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; print(\u0026quot;Preprocessing the data using PCA...\u0026quot;) (n, d) = X.shape X = X - np.tile(np.mean(X, 0), (n, 1)) (l, M) = np.linalg.eig(np.dot(X.T, X)) Y = np.dot(X, M[:, 0:no_dims]) return Y def tsne(X=np.array([]), no_dims=2, initial_dims=50, perplexity=30.0): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Runs t-SNE on the dataset in the NxD array X to reduce its dimensionality to no_dims dimensions.

The default value is 2 for 2-dimensional space. Perplexity: The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that are used in t-SNE algorithms. Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity. Perplexity can have a value between 5 and 50. The default value is 30. n_iter: Maximum number of iterations for optimization. Should be at least 250 and the default value is 1000 learning_rate: The learning rate for t-SNE is usually in the range [10.0, 1000.0] with the default value of 200.0.   3. Comparation between PCA and t-SNE   The PCA is a linear algorithm which is not able to interpret complex ploynomial relationship between features. By contrast, t-SNE is actived based on probability distributions on neighbourhood graph to understand the structure with the data; The linear dimension reduction algorithm (PCA) concentrates on placing dissimilar data points far apart in a lower dismension representation, while the nonlinear algorithm (t-SNE) places the similar datapoints closely together in lower dimesional space. Hence, as can be seen in the following figure, PCA can only capture linear structures in the features. The t-SNE algorithm works in a very different way and focuses to preserve the local distances of the high-dimensional data in some mapping to low-dimensional data.    import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.manifold import TSNE X = np.loadtxt(\u0026quot;mnist2500_X.txt\u0026quot;) labels = np.loadtxt(\u0026quot;mnist2500_labels.txt\u0026quot;) ## implementing by PCA pca = PCA(n_components=2, svd_solver='full') data_to_show_PCA = pca.fit_transform(X) ## implementing by t-SNE data_to_show_tSNE = TSNE(n_components=2).fit_transform(X) ## Figure PCA fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(20, 8)) scatter1 = ax[0].scatter(data_to_show_PCA[:, 0], data_to_show_PCA[:, 1], 50, labels, alpha=0.4) for i, txt in enumerate(labels[0:50]): ax[0].annotate(txt, (data_to_show_PCA[i, 0], data_to_show_PCA[i, 1])) ax[0].set_title('PCA', fontsize=16) ax[0].set_xlabel('Principal 1') ax[0].set_ylabel('Principal 2') legend1 = ax[0].legend(*scatter1.legend_elements(), loc=\u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Digit\u0026quot;) ax[0].add_artist(legend1) fig.suptitle('Visualize high-dimensional data points through \\n PCA and t-SNE', fontsize=16) ## Figure t-SNE scatter2 = ax[1].scatter(data_to_show_tSNE[:, 0], data_to_show_tSNE[:, 1], 50, labels, alpha=0.4) for i, txt in enumerate(labels[0:50]): ax[1].annotate(txt, (data_to_show_tSNE[i, 0], data_to_show_tSNE[i, 1])) ax[1].set_title('t-SNE', fontsize=16) ax[1].set_xlabel('Dimension 1') ax[1].set_ylabel('Dimension 2') legend2 = ax[1].legend(*scatter2.legend_elements(), loc=\u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Digit\u0026quot;) ax[1].add_artist(legend2) plt.savefig('PCA_t-SNE.png') plt.show()  References   A tutorial on Principal Components Analysis  Principal component analysis  PCA: A Practical Guide to Principal Component Analysis in R \u0026amp; Python  A simple introduction to PCA.

Take partial derivative with respect to $\\omega$ and $b$, the iteration strategy can be obtained: $$\\begin{align} \u0026amp; \\omega \\leftarrow \\omega +\\eta {{y}_{i}}{{x}_{i}} \\\n\u0026amp; b\\leftarrow b+\\eta {{y}_{i}} \\\n\\end{align}$$ where $\\eta$ is a learning rate hyperparameter set by user.\nBased on the aforementioned discussion, the perceptron algorithm can be derived: $\\omega$, $b$\n  Preceptron algorithm   Input: training data set: $T = { (x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\cdots, (x_N, y_N)}$, $i = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, N$; learning rate $\\eta (0 \u0026lt; \\eta \\le 1)$; Output: $\\omega$, $b$ and preceptron model: $f(x) = sign(\\omega \\centerdot x+b)$ Initialize $\\omega_0, b_0$; while: Choosing the single instance $(x_i, y_i)$ from $T$ until no misclassfication data contained in the set;  if $y_i \\left( \\omega \\cdot x_i +b\\right) \\le 0$  $\\omega \\leftarrow \\omega +\\eta {y_i}{x_i}$ and $b\\leftarrow b+\\eta {{y}_{i}}$  endif end while   Implementing the algorithm in python3 from matplotlib import pyplot as plt import numpy as np from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation # define a function to realize preceptron algorithm. def PrecessingPreceptron(point, learning_rate): w_set = [] b_set = [] w = np.array([0,0]) b = 0 flag = 1 while flag: flag = 0 i = 0 for i in range(len(point)): if point[i,2]*(np.matmul(w, point[i,0:2]) + b) \u0026lt;= 0: w = w + learning_rate * point[i,0:2] * point[i,2] b = b + learning_rate * point[i,2] w_set.append(w) b_set.append(b) flag = 1 break if flag == 0: break return w_set, b_set # DrawFigure is used to draw the process def DrawFigure(count, w_set, b_set, gap): point_x_1 = 0 point_x_2 = 5 if count == 0: line.set_data([], []) return line, if gap*count \u0026lt; len(w_set): w = w_set[count*gap] b = b_set[count*gap] else: w = w_set[-1] b = b_set[-1] if w[1] != 0: point_y_1 = -(w[0] * point_x_1 + b) / w[1] point_y_2 = -(w[0] * point_x_2 + b) / w[1] thisx = np.array([point_x_1, point_x_2]) thisy = np.array([point_y_1, point_y_2]) line.set_data(thisx, thisy) return line, if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: # define input data set traning_data = np.array([[3, 4, 1],[4, 3, 1], [3,3,-1],[1,2,-1],[3,5,1],[4,7,1],[3,2,-1],[1.5,5,-1]]) learning_rate = 0.7 fig, ax = plt.subplots() line, = ax.plot([], [], 'k-') for index in range(len(traning_data)): if traning_data[index,2] == 1: ax.plot(traning_data[index, 0], traning_data[index, 1], 'ro') else: ax.plot(traning_data[index,0], traning_data[index,1],'bo') plt.xlabel('$x_1$') plt.ylabel('$x_2$') plt.title('Preceptron algorithm learning precess') w_set, b_set = PrecessingPreceptron(traning_data, learning_rate) anim = FuncAnimation(fig, DrawFigure,frames=np.arange(0, 15), fargs=(w_set, b_set, 50), interval=300, blit=True) anim.save('preceptron.gif', writer='imagemagick') plt.show()  Results: Notes   It can be testified that the perceptron algorithm could converge at last within the limited steps of iterations.

Hence, the main process will block when you use ros::spin() function until the the node shutdown. ros::spin() equals to  while(ros::ok()){ ros::spinonce(); }   If you want to subscribe and publish message using the same node, you can refer to this example by Dhruv Ilesh Shah.
