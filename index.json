Creating the publisher is an expensive operation, so it\u0026rsquo;s a usually a bad idea to creat a new ros::Publisher object each time you want to publish a message.

Hence, the main process will block when you use ros::spin() function until the the node shutdown. ros::spin() equals to  while(ros::ok()){ ros::spinonce(); }   If you want to subscribe and publish message using the same node, you can refer to this example by Dhruv Ilesh Shah.
